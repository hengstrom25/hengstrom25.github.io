Keeping up with coding is hard. Having finished the Flatiron School program a few months ago, I sometimes find it difficult to keep up the motivation to keep pushing myself. 

Sometimes you need to take a step back. I found myself feeling overwhelmed and falling behind this week. After a few days, I finally realized that I need to give myself some breathing room. I am busy at work, busy at home, and I need otto be feeling good about the work that I've been doing. 

I came home from work a few days ago and sat down at my computer and decided to add a new button to my new program. I hadn't done that in weeks - just sit down on a Tuesday and do something. It felt amazing. I got it to work right away and I was so excited to get something like that done! 

I've found myself needing to remind myself why I'm doing this. Moments like those are a great reminder of why I spent 15 months pushing myself to graduate. I need to figure out how to prioritize coding and take a step back from some of the other things I've been trying to do.

I had a great job interview this week and I'm excited to spend the new few weeks focusing on Javascript and front end development. I'm excited and energized and I am already looking forward to writing another technical blog post this week about Javascript challenges. 

Until next time!
