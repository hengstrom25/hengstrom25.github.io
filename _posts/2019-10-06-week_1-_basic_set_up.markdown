Getting out of school mode is harder than I anticipated. Creating an app with no guidelines means that it can be hard to figure out what to do first. Where do you start? How will the app function? What kind of features do I want to use? 

What I've decided to do is to start with the basics. I set up the users, sessions, and static pages controllers in Rails, which I have chosen for the back end. Next, I set up a users table using ActiveRecord, which I may later switch to Postgres when deploying to a site like Heroku. 

Next, I need to add some routes or the app won't know which code to look at on a given page. I added a static pages home and sessions routes to my config file. 

Adding a simple home page has my app up and running!

I will spend the next week coming up with ideas for functionality and visuals, but for now I will rejoice in having a working Rails app!
