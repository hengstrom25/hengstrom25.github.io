Rejection is undoubtedly one of the worst parts of any job search. You find a positon you are excited about, apply, maybe you have an interview or two, and then you get the "Thanks but no thanks" email. Sometimes you don't even get that far - and sometimes (most of the time?) you never hear anything at all. 

As an opera singer turned web developer, I am kind of an expert in rejection. In the opera world, we affectionately call the rejection letter a "PFO" - or "please *** off". A bit crass? Maybe, but it's become such a normal part of the operatic vernacular that now it just rolls off the tongue. (Plus it's a way to laugh a little about the inevitable sting each time you receive one of these, sometimes hilariously written, letters.) 

Back when I was applying to vocal programs, I would send upwards of 50+ applications per year, most of which required non-refundable application fees. Sometimes I would get an audition, sometimes not (and they kept my money anyway!). At first, the rejections hurt. I had been working hard on my technique and on my audition prep and I just wanted a chance to sing for someone! But after 10 or 20, the sting started to lessen. I was able to focus on the auditions I DID get and just move on from the ones I didn't. When I won a job, it felt like all of the work and struggle was worth it. 

Fast forward a few years and now I'm in the middle of another, different, job search. Instead of sending pre-screening recordings and operatic resumes, I am completing code challenges and sending in technical resumes. I am applying to at least a dozen jobs per week, sending follow up emails, networking, and working on my technical skills. In many ways, it feels just like my experience through my opera auditions, just a little quieter. 

Rejection is never easy. You spend hours, months, years honing your skills and building credibility and it can be seemingly tossed aside in a single email. It can hurt and the closer you get to the final rounds the harder it can be. But the best thing you can do is just keep trying. Try to learn something every time, make a joke to make yourself feel better, and move forward.
