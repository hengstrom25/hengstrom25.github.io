Hi! My first blog post of my first blog of my training at Flatiron School. 

How did I get myself into this? It's a long story that spans decades, but I'll keep it to just a few major points:

When I was a kid, I said I wanted to be a software engineer like my dad, following the family's footsteps. 

Instead, I followed in a different verison of the family's footsteps and went to music school, majoring in vocal performance and opera. After graduating, I ended up as a receptionst at an architecture and interior design firm. Fast forward 9 years, I am the head of the interiors department and feeling something missing in my professional life. 

During an extended job search, I came across the Flatiron School through the suggestion of one of my husband's clients. The more I looked into the program, the more excited I got about it. I started the bootcamp prep and enrolled in the school just a few days later. 

It's been 2 weeks now since I enrolled and I can't get enough. Every spare minute is spent working on the coursework and doing everything I can to understand it. I am eager to learn as much as I can and I am really excited to see where this new knowledge takes me!

Until next time! 

Heidi
