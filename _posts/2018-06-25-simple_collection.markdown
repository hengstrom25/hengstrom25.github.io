The final project for this section is a CLI Data Gem Project. While I found the assignment rather intimidating at first, once I really figured out what the goal was I was able to focus and set a plan. 

I decided to create a program that would allow the user to navigate through a knitting pattern collection called The Simple Collection by Tin Can Knits. The user would be able to see the full list of patterns, select one from the list, and then see a list of information about the pattern. 

The first week was a struggle. I battled with issues with the IDE not saving my work and the files not talking to each other within my program. Many hours and several screen shares later, the issues were kinks were finally ironed out and I could start programming. 

My first goal was to set the framework for the program. I wrote a simple CLI with filler information so I could start building the program. I was a little ambitious when I first got started - I'd originally planned to make the selections quite a bit more complicated - but I simplified the plan once I got more involved in the coding. 

Once I had the CLI figured out and could do some basic tests, I started building the methods. I figured the scraping part would be the most complicated and finicky and I wanted to get some code on the screen. 

Fortunately, the files continued to work as expected and I was able to follow the guidance of the instructors to solve issues as they came up. I continue to see how valuable error messages are and making even a little progress can be huge. 

Scraping. This was rather intimidating. I took this one step at a time. I had several steps here - first, get the names of the patterns in a list, then scrape the information from each pattern page so it would populate my program. My goal was to start with too much information and then narrow it down as I went. I learned a lot about reading the information the program is provinding - this made it much easier to figure out the next route rather than battling with the Developer Tools for hours on end. 

I can't tell you how exciting it was to see it work! When I got the list of patterns to actually work I was overjoyed! The next section went much more quickly. Now that I had narrowed down how to get information from the website and CSS, I was able to narrow down the CSS selectors and got the pattern information working. 

After simplifying a few things, I went back in and started the scary task of commenting out code that I didn't think I needed and deleting extraneous folders. After all of the issues with the files early on this was pretty nervewracking, but I am fortunate that nothing went awry and the program seems to work pretty well!

I love showing off what I've done! It's a proud moment! 

On to the next challenge!
