When I was first learning Ruby, the spaceship operator was one of my favorites. It made me smile every time I saw it!

While working on a code challenge this weekend, I found myself using the spaceship operator. I was so excited to put it into practice that I wanted to write about it!

First of all, what is the spaceship operator? What does it look like?

`<=>`

See? A little spaceship! Cute!

This particular operator is a comparison operator, so it compares two items and returns a value:

-returns 0 if the first item equals the second

-returns -1 if the first item is less than the second

-returns 1 if the first item is greater than the second

This can be used when sorting, when trying to run a comparison and then doing something else with the result, etc. It's a fun tool and comes in super handy!
