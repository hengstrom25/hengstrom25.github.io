I have been thinking a lot about my new app and while I'm excited about a lot of what is to come, I realized I needed a front end to get the app running. It's hard to know if something is working when you have nothing to look at. 

My initial plan is to have a Rails backend and Javascript front end. I don't want to use frameworks right away - instead I want to really try to sharpen my Javascript skills. 

Unfortunately, the portfolio project I am using as guidance only used Javascript on a few of the pages, so I'm left with a lot to figure out on my own. I suppose that's the whole point. 

The way I'd set up my app required a user to be logged in order to see anything, so I needed to set up my log in page and button. Because I seeded my file ahead of time, I had a user to practice with. After some trial and error, including adding some needed Gems to my Gemfile, I was able to get a functioning log in page that directed to the json of the user! Not quite the result I want ultimately, but a good start! 

The next stage will be to set up the sign up page and get all of the exiting links to work and display more than json. Sounds simple, but something tells me I have my work cut out for me!

Until next time!
