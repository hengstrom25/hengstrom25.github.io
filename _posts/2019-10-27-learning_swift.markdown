One aspect of programming I have been itching to learn is mobile development. My app, Recipe Box, is one that I originally set out to make into a mobile app so I could actually use it, maybe even releasing it on the app store! 

I ordered a book on Swift programming and iOS. Since it was developed by Apple, it's the language I can use to make my dream a reality. One of the things I was excited about with the app was that it solved a problem in my own life, and make the app accessible on more than just my local host would make the app more functional and fun to use. 

I'm excited about this next step and I can't wait to track my progress!
