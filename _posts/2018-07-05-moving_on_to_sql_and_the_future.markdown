The whole concept of SQL is like a match made in heaven with the kind of work I like to do. When I started the first lesson and saw that it was all about charts and data and fun ways to extract just what you need... I was sold. Of course, I'm still learning concepts and the actual techniques to solve the labs, but what fun it is! 

Part of what I like about the idea of programming is creating something that makes sense and that works. I've learned that the latter is sometimes easier said than done, but there's something so appealing about the idea of figuring out a problem. As I look around in the world and use my computer and my phone and any other electronic device, I've started thinking about the programming that had to go into it. What complex programs had to be written to make things work and how we take advantage of the fact that, more often than not, they work the way we want. (Maybe not a computer all the time, but a pre-timed coffee pot can pretty reliably make coffee when you want it to as long as you've actually put in the right time and the ingredients!) 

I'm about a third of the way into this program. I am anxious to get to some front end development - I think that's where I will really have some fun. Until then, onward!
