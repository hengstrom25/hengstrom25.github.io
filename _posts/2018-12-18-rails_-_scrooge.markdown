My portfolio project for the Rails section is an app called Scrooge, which is a budget tracking app. 

This is a complex project that includes a great deal of Active Record Associations, Forms, Nested Routes, Controllers, and much more. 

The most important step for this project was getting the Schema and Model Objects set up. The associations include a various range of relationships, including a complex many_to_many relationship with a join table and user submittable attributes. Figuring out the best way to implement these associates taught me a great deal about Active Record and how the different Model Objects relate to one another. 

Once the Schema was in good shape, I focused on the controllers and views. Validations were set up and error messages added to forms for each type to ensure proper data was saved to the database. I used Bootstrap and some basic layouts for UI/UX purposes and tried to see the app through the eyes of a User who had never seen it before. 

Overall, this project was a tremendous learning experience. I invite you to clone and run the app on your server and see how well you can stay on budget!
