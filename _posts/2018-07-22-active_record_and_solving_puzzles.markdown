I am really enjoying the section on ORMs and Active Record. Today, I was working on a lab for migrations and I had so much fun figuring out the different datatypes and getting all of the tests to pass. In the past, I've had to ask for help or spend considerable time looking around the internet to try to solve the labs, but this one clicked for me. 

A super helpful reference point was Stack Overflow, where I found the following list:

:binary
:boolean
:date
:datetime
:decimal
:float
:integer
:bigint
:primary_key
:references
:string
:text
:time
:timestamp

If one thing didn't work, I just tried another!

I've been having discussions with my dad about Stack Overflow and the name's reference to programming. I'm almost starting to feel like I'm "in the know."

As the days go on, I am getting to be more and more excited about finding a job in this world. I'm still not even 50% of the way through the program, but I'm plugging away! Every lab finished is one step closer to my future!
