As I continue to work on my recipe box project, it occured to me that I hadn't invested much time in the styling of the app! 

While I'm happy with the functionality, I've felt the styling was a bit lacking. I'd started a sort of 1950's theme early on with my selection of colors and fonts, but the margins and spacing were most defaults. I decided to tighten it up a bit to make it more pleasing to the eye. 

I started with the home page. I adjusted the left margin and the overall width of the page so the text would wrap around. I also adjusted the margins of the navbar component, giving more breathing room overall.

Next, I worked on the recipe card component, moving things around a bit, adding my fun fonts, and playing with the spacing.

The more I work on these, the more ideas I get and the more I want to try! There's more functionality I want to add to the app overall, but I'm enjoying spending a little time on CSS and adding some extra flair!
