“Nothing in the world is worth having or worth doing unless it means effort, pain, difficulty… I have never in my life envied a human being who led an easy life. I have envied a great many people who led difficult lives and led them well.” - Theodore Roosevelt

Burnout. It happens to the best of us. 

Bootcamps are tough. Job searches are tough. Especially when you're in a self-paced program, you have to find your own motivation and resources to push forward. When you reach the job search, you are on a high from finishing the program and are excited to jump right in. But after a few months, the excitement wanes and the job search becomes a job in and of itself. 

I am on week 9 of my job search. I have been diligently applying to jobs, sending follow up emails, adding features to my projects, and working on coding challenges all while working full time with a preschooler at home. Not to mention we just signed a new lease and we are packing up our apartment to move! 

It can be easy to resign yourself to being too busy and burnt out to keep going. I was sharing my frustrations with a friend recently after receiving another round of rejections. I told him it was hard to stay motivated and maybe it would be easier to just stay where I am. 

Instead of allowing me to continue my negativity, he reminded me of how hard I worked to get here. Hearing that from someone other than my closest circle was a welcome push to keep going. I HAVE worked hard. I started to remember how incredibly excited I was to graduate and get to this step. 

When you're struggling with burnout, remember why you are doing all of this in the first place. Everyone will have their own reasons and their own internal motivation. I am doing this to make a better life for my family. I want my little boy to know that his mommy did everything she could to give him an amazing life. 

I did this for him, but I also did it for myself. I don't want to give up. I think back at the moments during bootcamp when I felt accomplished, smart, and on top of the world. I have to hold onto those moments and know in my heart that this difficult time will pass and I will be able to feel that way every single day. 

There are some potentially exciting things brewing and I hope that they come to light. In the meantime, I will keep applying and riding the waves of motivation. It's ok to take a step back for a day or two, but keep pushing forward. It will be worth it. We all have to believe that.
