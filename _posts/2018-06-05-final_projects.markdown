I finally made it! I finished all of the initial Ruby coursework and made it to the Final Projects.  After so many weeks of work, I am very happy to finally be at a place where I can challenge myself and see what I've really learned. 

I am trying to figure out what I will do for my final project - It's a bit nervewracking to come up with something on my own. In the meantime, I am working hard on the Music Library CLI project and struggling through it. 

Hopefully in the next blog post or two, I will be more comfortable talking about actual programming in these posts. In the meantime, wish me luck on these projects!

Until next time!
