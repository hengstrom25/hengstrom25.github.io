My final project is a Recipe Box with a React/Redux Frontend and Rails Backend. 

I love to cook and in the digital age, I am often looking up recipes online. I find that I often have a hard time remembering where I found all of the different recipes and I wanted a central location to save them all. 

I started this project by building the back end in Rails, creating a database and seed file to use for development. 

I then used create-react-app to begin to build the front end. I wrote components for the different aspects of the site, including the home page, category card page, navigation bar, individual recipe cards, and the forms. 

This was the first app that I've played with styling and I had fun selected fonts and colors to use throughout the app. It has a 1950's feel to it which keeps it fun and cheeky. 

Happy cooking!
