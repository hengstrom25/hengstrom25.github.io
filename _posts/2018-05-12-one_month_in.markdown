It's amazing how much can happen in a month. 

Over the past few weeks, I've really had to challenge myself to maintain a balance between my studies and daily life. In just the last 2 weeks, I've had an unexpected business trip, a death in the family (and another several days away), and a handful of social engagements that have been taking me away from my studies. 

I've found that even when I am unable to get to the computer on a given day, I spend a large part of the day thinking about the course work and the lab I'm currently working on. I feel a determination to truly understand what it is I am learning and, even when I struggle to find a solution, I read as much as I can and look at different options to find the most elegant way to solve a problem. 

I continue to have great motivation to move forward and continue to expand my knowledge of the course material. I am really excited to begin working my first project and I hope to get started in just a few weeks! I have a long planned vacation coming up and I am going to challenge myself to continue working a few hours each day to keep up my momentum. 

Until next time,
