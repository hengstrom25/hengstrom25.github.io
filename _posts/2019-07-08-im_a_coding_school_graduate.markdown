On July 3, 2019, I officially graduated from Flatiron School. 

I am a full stack web developer. 

After 15 months of hard work, it's amazing to have gotten this far. I've learned so much and I am excited to learn more. One of the wonderful things about coding is that there is always something new to learn since there are new things being created every day. 

Now that I have finished my coursework, I can reflect back on the past 15 months and what I have learned so far about being a developer. 

-Learning how to code and develop apps is hard, and that's ok. Ask for help when you are confused. It's not worth getting all the way to the end and realizing you did your entire project wrong because you were too afraid to ask for help.

-Practice. Practicing is the only way to really understand it. Type some code and see what happens. Error messages are your friend. They will help you know what's going wrong and what you need to fix. 

-Google with caution. There is a wealth of information online. There is also a wealth of wrong information online. Learn the sites that you trust. 

-Commit when you have something working. You can break it again later. 

-Practice talking about code. The terminology gets easier and the more you use it, the more you'll understand it. 

-Be sure you understand every single character, punctuation mark, and line in your code. You aren't doing yourself any favors by using code you don't understand. 

-Make sure you know your favorite methods and functions really, really well. There is a ton of information out there and there is so much to learn, but keep a firm hold on the fundamentals. 

-Don't give up. Some days it's hard and some days you feel like you can't do it. Talk to friends and family, take a day off. Then get back to work. 

I am excited about what the future holds and I can't wait to see where I'll be 15 months from now!
