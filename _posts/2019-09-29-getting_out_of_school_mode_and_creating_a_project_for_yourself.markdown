When we are in school, we create projects that have to fit into a mold. There are requirements we have to meet and every project is crafted with those requirements in mind. 

Once we graduate, it's hard to break out of that "school mode." I have been struggling with this myself. Several months have passed since I graduated Flatiron School and I am finding it difficult to be inspired to continue working on my school projects. While I am immensely proud of the work I did on my projects for school, it is difficult to find the motivation to continue working on the projects I made at school. 

I decided to come up with a new project to work on. Something I can be excited to work on and that I can call the shots on. If I don't want to use Redux, I don't have to! This project can be purely something I want to work on for my own enjoyment. 

As I discovered during the job search process, one of my passions is solving problems in the real world. As a mother of a 3 year old human child and a 7 year old canine child, my household is a constant state of chaos. Add to that a recent move, 2 adults with multiple jobs, and living in New York City, we barely manage to remember to even feed ourselves most days. Frequent dialouge on our home consists of: "Did you feed Gracie?" "Are the dishes clean or dirty?" "When did Zachary last have a bath?" 

As working musicians with "day jobs", our schedules are complicated. Days are long and nights are filled with rehearsals, gigs, and occassional family nights. With only one car, we have to "sign out" the car when we need it and juggle our rehearsal schedules with child care and understanding music directors. 

Our current system consists of Google calendar invites and tense realizations that we are double booked. I've realized something that can help us is a family calendar app that we can share and use together. I can add buttons for feeding our dog, taking her for a walk, vaccuming, laundry, etc. 

The more I think about it, the more I get excited about it. I love to create things that I can use and I can't wait to get started! This is my first programming project that is truly mine, and it's about the thing I love more than anything in the world: my family.
